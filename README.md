This project is a personal website using css.This project explains various concepts of css like Box-Modeling,Static,relative and absolute positionings and many more.

#Box-Model

In css Box-Model we will be learning about border,padding and margin.
.Border : The CSS border is a shorthand property used to set the border on an element. The CSS border properties are use to specify the style, color and size of the border of an element.
.Padding : An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border. 
.Margin : The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. 

#Display

Some of the important display properties are inline,block,inline-block,None.
.Inline : Displays an element as an inline element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect.
.Block : Displays an element as a block element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width.
.Inline-block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.
.None : The element is completely removed.

#Position

Some of the important position properties are Static,relative,absolute,fixed.
.Static : Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow.
.Absolute : The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.
.Relative : The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position.
.Fixed : The element is positioned relative to the browser window.
